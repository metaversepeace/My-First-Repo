      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>

      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
        6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
        7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
          - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).
